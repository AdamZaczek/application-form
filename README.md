#Aim of the app is to get input from workers and analyze it for further processing.

###Technologies used:

  #Ruby on Rails
  #Bootstrap
  #HTML 5 + CSS
  #Some cool rubygems like simple form


Database is running thanks to sqlite gem.
Adding new columns to the database should be done by rails generate migration add_nameofthecolumn_to_tablename nameofthecolumnt:forexamplestring.
After generating migration rake db:migrate needs to be run.
I made the form on Cloud 9 IDE and my server runs at https://application-form-adamzaczek.c9users.io/.
